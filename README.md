## About:

The "Property Proxy" extension provides a fairly transparent proxy for internal object properties hidden in custom non-zval implementations.

## Installation:

This extension is hosted at [PECL](http://pecl.php.net) and can be installed with [PEAR](http://pear.php.net)'s pecl command:

    # pecl install propro

Also, watch out for self-installing [pharext](https://github.com/m6w6/pharext) packages attached to [releases](https://github.com/m6w6/ext-propro/releases).

## Internals:

> ***NOTE:***
  This extension mostly only provides infrastructure for other extensions.
  See the [API docs here](http://m6w6.github.io/ext-propro/).
